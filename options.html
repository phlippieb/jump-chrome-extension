				<!-- Usage -->
				<h1>Usage</h1>
				
				<p>
					The jump extension lets you quickly navigate to URLs by entering keywords.
			  </p>
			  <p>
					To activate the extension, type "j" in the search bar and press space;
					you should see the jump icon appear, along with some suggestions.
			  </p>
			  <!-- TODO: add screenshots?.-->
			  <p>
					To jump to a URL that has been registered with a keyword, enter the keyword and hit enter.
					Alternatively, as you type, you will see suggestions appear underneath the search bar.
					You can jump to the top suggestion by pressing enter at any time.
			  </p>
			  <p>
					You can register URLs on this page.
					To register a new URL, add it in the "Add URL" field below, along with its keyword.
					Registered URLs are listed in the "URLs" table below.
					You can remove a registered URL by clicking on the "x" for that URL.
			  </p>
			  <p>
					<!-- TODO: make an issue for this feature and remove it from the help paragraph.-->
					Future feature:
	
					You will (hopefully) soon be able to add and remove URLs directly from the search bar.
					To add a registered URL, you will activate the extension (by typing "j" and a space), then type
					".add &lt;keyword&gt; &lt;url&gt;".
					To remove a registered URL, you will simply select the URL from your suggestions, and press delete
					(fn +
					delete on Mac, I think).
