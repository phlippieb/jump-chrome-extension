Jump is a Chrome extension that lets you jump to URLs really quickly.

## Installation

**jump** is (soon to be!) on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore). Install it just like you would any other extension.

## Usage

**jump** is an omnibox extension, which means it lives in your address bar.

To activate **jump**:
- Make sure the address bar is focused. Tip: learn the [shortcut key](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en).
- Type "j", followed by a space.
- That's it! You should see the jump logo pop up in the search bar.
