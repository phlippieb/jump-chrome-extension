Jump is a Chrome extension that lets you jump to URLs. It's like bookmarks, but _really fast_.

## Installation

**jump** is (soon to be!) on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore). Install it just like you would any other extension.

## Usage

**jump** is an omnibox extension, which means it lives in your address bar.

### Activating jump mode

To activate **jump**:
- Make sure the address bar is focused. 
- Type `j`, followed by a space.
- That's it! You should see the jump logo pop up in the search bar.

> Tip: learn a [shortcut key](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en) for focusing the address bar. My favourite is `cmd + l`.

Once **jump** is activated, you can either jump to one of your URLs, or go to the options page. If you have just installed **jump**, you will want to go the options page first.

Go to the options page by typing `,` in **jump**-mode.

The options page basically lets you manage your URLs. Here you can:
- Add a new URL under the "Register a new URL" section
- Remove existing URLs from the "Registered URLs" section

Registered URLs consiste of a **keyword** and a **URL**. The keyword is the part that you will type when you are **jump** mode, to jump to the URL.

> Tip: Keep your keywords distinct. You only need to type part of a keyword to select it, but the fewer characters you need to type to get the URL you want, the faster you become.
