Jump is a Chrome extension that lets you jump to URLs. It's like bookmarks, but _really fast_.

## Installation

**jump** is (soon to be!) on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore). Install it just like you would any other extension.

## Usage

**jump** is an omnibox extension, which means it lives in your address bar.

### Activating jump mode

To activate **jump**:
- Make sure the address bar is focused. 
- Type `j`, followed by a space.
- That's it! You should see the jump logo pop up in the search bar.

> Tip: learn a [shortcut key](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/157179?hl=en) for focusing the address bar. My favourite is `cmd + l`.

Once **jump** is activated, you can either jump to one of your URLs, or go to the options page. If you have just installed **jump**, you will want to go the options page first.

## Options page

Go to the options page by typing `,` in **jump**-mode.

The options page basically lets you manage your URLs. Here you can:
- Add a new URL under the "Register a new URL" section
- Remove existing URLs from the "Registered URLs" section

Registered URLs consiste of a **keyword** and a **URL**. The keyword is the part that you will type when you are **jump** mode, to jump to the URL.

> Tip: Keep your keywords distinct. You only need to type part of a keyword to select it, but the fewer characters you need to type to get the URL you want, the faster you become.

Once you have registered some URLs, you're all set to start using **jump**.

## Jumping

To jump to a registered URL, simply type its keyword while in **jump** mode. As you type, the top suggestion will indicate which registered URL is selected. You'll notice that you don't have to type the complete keyword.

With a URL selected as the top result, simply press `enter` to jump to it!

You can also use the arrow keys to move up and down between suggestions. However, if you find yourself doing this a lot,  your keywords might benefit from some refinement. The idea is to jump as quickly as possible.
